This program will give a grid popup for the user to draw a maze on with the mouse. left click adds wall blocks, while right click removes them.
once sastisfied with the maze drawn press enter and it will attempt to find the fastest path from the green space to the red space using A-star algorithm.
Can also move the colored spots by hovering over a different block and pressing 1 to move the green starting position, or 2 to move the red ending position.
After fastest path is found (assuming a path actually exists) press the space bar to reset the grid.
