# VisualPathFinding
This program will give a grid popup for the user to draw a maze on with the mouse. It will attempt to find the fastest path from the green space to the red space using A-star algorithm. Can also move the colored spots by hovering over a different block and pressing 1 to move the green starting position, or 2 to move the red ending position.
